## Motivation

The motivation behind this project is to be able to attract more users to discover and use Paladin products. We started with Warlord which is the only index for governance tokens in the market and we will expand to other products in the future.

## Architecture

The project has three main components:
- The contracts that make up the protocol in solidity [(in the contracts folder)](contracts/README.md)
- The front-end interface for users [(in the front-end folder)](front-end/README.md)
- The operator server that handles the auto compounding [(in the operator folder)](operator/README.md)
