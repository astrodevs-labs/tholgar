# Redeem

To redeem in $AURA/$CVX, you will need to first withdraw your $tWAR into $WAR tokens ([see how](withdraw.md)).

Once you have $WAR tokens in your wallet, you will need to go to Paladin's Warlord app to initiate the redemption process.

The instructions can be found here <https://doc.paladin.vote/warlord/redeeming-war>
