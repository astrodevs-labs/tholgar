# Redeem

To redeem in AURA/CVX, you will first have to withdraw your tWAR into WAR tokens ([see how](withdraw.md)).

Once you have WAR tokens in your wallet, you will need to go to Paladin's Warlord app to initiate the reddem process.

The instructions can be found here <https://doc.paladin.vote/warlord/redeeming-war>
