# Overview

![](./assets/logoFull.png)

Tholgar is a DeFi protocol that builds products on top of other DeFi protocols, enabling users to achieve higher yields than they could achieve individually.  

We foster synergy with Paladin Vote stakeholders to build products that will benefit the entire ecosystem.  

Our first product is an auto-compounder built on top of Warlord, allowing anyone to participate in a vault and attain higher, more optimized yields in a non-custodial manner.
